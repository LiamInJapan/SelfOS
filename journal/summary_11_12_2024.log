Summary of Conversation
=======================
Start Time: 2024-12-10 21:00:00 (this is the start of this project!)
End Time: 2024-12-11 22:45:00

Key Points Discussed
--------------------
1. Discussed low-level system programming, including bootloader and kernel development.
2. Explored creating a minimal operating system capable of interacting with an AI like ChatGPT.
3. Worked through debugging issues with bootloader and kernel interaction, including QEMU setup and disk image inspection.
4. Brainstormed the concept of a self-writing operating system:
   - Chatlog-based journaling for development history.
   - Whether constructs like files and filesystems are necessary given AI's potential.
   - How new paradigms (AI, VR, quantum computing) might drive fundamentally new OS designs.
5. Decided to incorporate a journaling system into the project, with daily conversation logs and Git-based versioning.

Additional Notes
----------------
- Some ideas I would like to explore from here are:
   - Can we build a routine / workflow from here, such as:
      - Recap our notes
      - Talk about observations / thoughts / research done since last engagement
      - Dive into implementation and practical work
      - Wrap up, summarise, update journal, note next steps
   - Coming back to the files and filesystem comment, is there a way that I can "flatten" (and preferably compress) a repository and send it to an LLM for an overall codebase analysis? Can this be compared against notes/conversation logs (this type of workflow may well be interesting later on too)
